# Reinforcement Learning Exploration Baselines (RLeXplore)

RLeXplore is a set of implementations of exploration approaches in reinforcement learning using PyTorch, which can be deployed in arbitrary algorithms in a plug-and-play manner. 

# Installation
- Get the repository with git:
```
git clone https://github.com/yuanmingqi/rl-exploration-baselines.git
```
Run the following command to get dependencies:
```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# Usage Example
```python

```
